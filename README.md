# Paket.Unity3D

Use Paket and NuGet dependencies in Unity3D projects

* place a `paket.unity3d.references` file next to your Unity3D projects `Assets` directory
* run paket as you would for .Net projects to gather the dependencies in your paket.dependencies file
* run paket.unity3d.exe from the root of your project to install dependencies into your Unity3D project(s)
